Hello there and welcome to my Data Portfolio "curiosity"

You must be asking yourself why is it named curosity.

Oxford Dictionary defines curiosity as

noun
1. a strong desire to know of learn something.
2. an unusual or interesting object or fact


This portfolio is a container for projects which I have have been motivated to know or learn about, and I endeavour to help you walk away having gleaned at least one unusual or interesting fact.

Please fell welcome to ask any questions about the projects in this repository.

Contrary to popular belief cuiosity did not kill the cat. It killed static ways of thinking.
